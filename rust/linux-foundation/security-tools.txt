AFL.rs -> is a fuzzy tool for automatically discovering vulnerabilities in software.

Honggfuzz -> similar to AFL.rs but allwos fuzzing of native rust and non-rust programs
	uses genetic algorithms to mutates input data and measure code coverage.

Rustscan -> network scannig tool to Rust concurrency features. Uses multithreading to scan multiple ports simultaneously. Manage socket to minimize overhead.

Rustls -> TLS library emphasizes security, making it suitable for secure networking applications. Implements modern cryptographic protocols to protect data agains eavesdropping and tampering.
Manages the handshake between client and server.

cargo-audit -> audits Cargo.lock files for known vulnerable dependencies.

RustSec -> is a security advisory organization and database for Rust.

Cargo-Geiger -> scans Rust projects for usage of unsafe code. Analyzes the dependencies listed in Cargo.toml file for Rust Project.

Parity Ehtereum -> is an Ethereum client built in Rust.
