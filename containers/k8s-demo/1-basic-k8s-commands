View Context

In the terminal run the following command:

$ kubectl config view



The output should look similar to this:

apiVersion: v1

clusters:

- cluster:

    certificate-authority-data: DATA+OMITTED

    server: https://127.0.0.1:6443

  name: rancher-desktop

contexts:

- context:

    cluster: rancher-desktop

    user: rancher-desktop

  name: rancher-desktop

current-context: rancher-desktop

kind: Config

preferences: {}

users:

- name: rancher-desktop

  user:

    client-certificate-data: REDACTED

    client-key-data: REDACTED



This command displays the current cluster you are pointed to.



Note the current context as noted above:

current-context: rancher-desktop



Get Nodes

In a terminal run the following command to get all the nodes of the cluster you are targeting:

$ kubectl get nodes



The output should look something similar to the following:

NAME                   STATUS   ROLES                  AGE   VERSION

lima-rancher-desktop   Ready    control-plane,master   25d   v1.24.10+k3s1



Depending on the number of nodes in your cluster you might see more than one. If you are using Rancher Desktop you will only see one node.

Get Namespaces

In a terminal run the following command:

$ kubectl get namespaces



The output should look something similar to this:

NAME              STATUS   AGE

default           Active   3m53s

kube-system       Active   3m53s

kube-public       Active   3m53s

kube-node-lease   Active   3m53s



Get Pods

In a terminal run the following command to get all the pods running on the cluster you are targeting:

$ kubectl get pods



If you are using a new cluster you should see the following:

No resources found in default namespace.



This is because there are no pods running in the current namespace you are in.

To view all pods in all namespaces we will need to add the `-A` flag to show all pods across all name spaces:

$ kubectl get pods -A



The output should look something like this:

NAMESPACE     NAME                                                       READY   STATUS      RESTARTS   AGE
